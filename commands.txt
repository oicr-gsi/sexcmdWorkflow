## Commands
This section lists command(s) run by WORKFLOW workflow

* Running SEXCMD workflow

The workflow accepts a single fastq file which may be any of R1 or R2 files for paired reads sequencing.
In a case when the workflow fails to find enough information to deduce the sex of the donor
it will still generate a report which would say that sex is UNDEFINED

### Generate report

'''

  touch PREFIX.OUTPUT
  Rscript  SEXCMD.R 
          -m REFERENCE_FASTA
          -t SEQUENCING_TYPE
          -s SEX_MODEL
          -f INPUT_FASTQ
          -p OUTPUT_PREFIX

  python3 snippet:

  outputFile = "PREFIX.OUTPUT"
  reportString = "Sex_Determination\tRatio of X and Y counts is NA\tSex of this sample BASENAME_OF_FASTQ is UNDEFINED\n"
  numberOfLines = 0

  with open(outputFile, "r") as inp:
      numberOfLines = len(inp.readlines())
  inp.close()

  if numberOfLines == 0:
      """Write down the string"""
      with open(outputFile, "w") as m:
          m.writelines(reportString)
      m.close()
